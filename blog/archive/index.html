  </h4>
  <p>When I started my first Go project last fall ‚Äì a web service backed by PostgreSQL ‚Äì getting a test suite setup was my first priority. Since I had no clue how to write Go, I figured tests would be the best way to tell whether my code worked.</p>

<p>Setting up a full integration test suite, running against a local test database, ended up being a big project in itself. Frameworks like Rails provide this out of the box, but the Go community eschews monolithic frameworks and embraces small, focused libraries. I've grown to appreciate that a lot, but it created a much steeper learning curve.</p>

<p>This post shares how I write end-to-end integration tests in Go, with very little code. My tests run against a local PostgreSQL server, and make real HTTP calls to ensure that my services work as a whole.</p>

  <p>I freelanced much of my way through college, to pay bills, but also to get way more real-world exposure to technology. But I kept freelancing for a few years too many, and a couple years after college I really just wanted a real job again.</p>

<p>My job search basically consisted of two options: Apple, or startups. My interviews at Apple went well. So well that I found myself driving down to Apple for an all-day interview, with a working lunch break at the cafeteria with a pair of VPs.</p>

<p>As I sat down in the middle of the cafeteria with the VPs, I immediately got distracted. Steve Jobs, in full mock turtleneck regalia, had just walked past the window next to us. Perhaps a good omen? Well, at least something to add color to a day spent sitting in a room all day.</p>

<p>The interview was just getting started when Steve decided to park himself and his friends at the table directly next to us. As in, close enough to bump into when I got up if I wasn‚Äôt careful. Gulp.</p>

    <a href="/blog/2009/10/06/granola/"></a>
  </h4>
  <p>Have you noticed that any <strong>good</strong> granola costs five or six bucks per box? And it&rsquo;s a 12-ounce box. That&rsquo;s fracking ridiculous, especially since I learned how to make granola in elementary school. It probably wasn&rsquo;t that great (I remember it including a bunch of vegetable oil&hellip;ewww), but still cheap.</p>

<p>I decided to stop buying granola from the store. I can make a BETTER granola that&rsquo;s also CHEAPER. Christian&rsquo;s law states that BETTER + CHEAPER = DOUBLE PLUS GOOD.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/">Mark Bittman</a> is pretty much the go-to guy for quick, cheap, good eats, so I based mine off <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/recipe-of-the-day-crunchy-granola/">this granola recipe he posted earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/2009/10/06/granola/tumblr_kr2w9fsbj21qz8pzc.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>I changed a few things. First, I couldn&rsquo;t find unsweetened coconut, so I left that out. He says it&rsquo;s ok to do so, and I trusted him. I wanted a subtly sweet granola, so I added about 2/3rds cup of honey. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla, and a tablespoon or two of peanut oil. For dried fruit, I added an even mixture of dried strawberries, bananas, and cranberries.</p>

<p>The raw granola was AMAZING. I mean, granola has gotten a pretty bad reputation, since the hippies co-opted its goodness for political gain. Great granola has a really great, subtle flavor. The honey, peanut oil, and cinnamon are great together. The hippies can take their flax seeds and soy nuts and put it in their vegan cookies, for all I care.</p>

<p>It was still good after baking for 25 minutes, but I learned a few things, which I&rsquo;ll rectify  in a month when I&rsquo;ve run out of granola again. First, I didn&rsquo;t have a normal baking sheet you&rsquo;d use for granola. You know, one with sides about a half an inch or so thick. I only have a flat sheet. So I piled the granola on top and mushed it into a big rectangular bar, which caused the sides of the granola to nearly burn, because I couldn&rsquo;t stir the granola at all.</p>

<p>Also, I mixed the granola in my Kitchen-Aid stand mixer, instead of hand-mixing. This was really efficient, since it took about 30 seconds on the 2-speed to perfectly blend everything. It came out fine, but the almonds and oats were crushed.</p>

<p>Lastly, the final granola was crumbly, instead of the nice clumpy style that I like. I&rsquo;ll either need to cut out the oil, or add more honey or another ingredient to bind the oats together. Egg whites, perhaps?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a basic Lemon Butter sauce with parsley, but I also added a few teaspoons of capers and a clove of garlic which took it to another level. I think the sauce could have been a bit stronger, and I‚Äôm going to continue to experiment. Here‚Äôs the recipe so far ‚Äì send me your suggestions:</p>

  </h4>
  <p>While doing some iPhone hacking tonight, I had to write some code to parse some XML documents, and noticed that neither NSXMLDocument or NSXMLParser were available in my local iPhone documentation set.</p>

<p>I eventually discovered that the iPhone SDK does include support for event-based XML parsing via NSXMLParser, but not DOM-based parsing. This makes sense, but I&rsquo;m still not sure why NSXMLParser is missing from my documentation.</p>
