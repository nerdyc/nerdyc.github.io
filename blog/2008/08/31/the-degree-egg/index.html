        The 165-175 Degree Egg<br />
        <small>Aug 31 2008</small>
      </h2>
      
      <p>I don&rsquo;t actually like eggs that much. When I do eat them, they are likely scrambled, and covered with hot sauce, and I&rsquo;m probably hungover. Last weekend, I tried Eggs Florentine for the first time and barely ate half of it.</p>

<p>But something intrigued me this morning after reading about <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/08/how-to-boil-an-egg">the 65-degree egg on kottke.org</a>. So I whipped out my thermometer, a big pot, and started experimenting:</p>

<p>Runny eggs especially freak me out, so I opted to try a 165 and 175 degree egg, as opposed to the 149-degree egg. I pulled the first one out, and broke the shell too hard, but the inside was unlike any other egg I&rsquo;d had. It had the consistency of custard, and the yellow was putty-like. I particularly hate the chalky yellows of regular boiled eggs (henceforth known as the 212-degree egg), so this was incredible. The only problem was that I took it out too early, and the texture wasn&rsquo;t consistent throughout the egg.</p>

<p>I plowed on with the second egg and raised the temperature, hoping for a more consistent, and firmer egg. That&rsquo;s exactly what I got:</p>

<p>This too was better than any boiled egg I&rsquo;d ever had before, but it was too close to what I&rsquo;m used to having. It tasted and felt great, but wasn&rsquo;t as creamy as the 165-degree egg. I think I under-cooked the 165-degree egg, and perhaps over-cooked the 175-degree egg.</p>

<p>In short: I&rsquo;m never boiling eggs the same way, and I&rsquo;m becoming more comfortable eating eggs.</p>
