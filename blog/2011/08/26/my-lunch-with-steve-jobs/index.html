        My "Lunch" with Steve Jobs<br />
        <small>Aug 26 2011</small>
      </h2>
      
      <p>I freelanced much of my way through college, to pay bills, but also to get way more real-world exposure to technology. But I kept freelancing for a few years too many, and a couple years after college I really just wanted a real job again.</p>

<p>My job search basically consisted of two options: Apple, or startups. My interviews at Apple went well. So well that I found myself driving down to Apple for an all-day interview, with a working lunch break at the cafeteria with a pair of VPs.</p>

<p>As I sat down in the middle of the cafeteria with the VPs, I immediately got distracted. Steve Jobs, in full mock turtleneck regalia, had just walked past the window next to us. Perhaps a good omen? Well, at least something to add color to a day spent sitting in a room all day.</p>

<p>The interview was just getting started when Steve decided to park himself and his friends at the table directly next to us. As in, close enough to bump into when I got up if I wasn&rsquo;t careful. Gulp.</p>



<p>So I found myself spending the next 30 minutes being interviewed while sitting next to Steve Jobs, who was clearly in earshot. I could have tried to listen in on his conversation too, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared. Remember that scene in Pirates of Silicon Valley where Noah Wyle goes off on that job applicant from IBM? That didn&rsquo;t happen, but perhaps Steve was just feeling generous that day.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the job, which I found out later was really for the best. It wasn&rsquo;t a good fit and I went on to work in startups where I felt right in my element. But that interview at Apple will definitely go down as the most memorable and stressful I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
