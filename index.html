        <p>
          I make iOS and Mac apps in San Francisco. I'm particularly good at launching products, and mostly work with early-stage startups. Iâ€™ve led engineering teams, managed products, and even designed stuff too. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
          I'm available for consulting. <a href="mailto:christian@nerdyc.com">Contact me</a> to get help building an iOS app or Mac app, or prototyping your product.

          <p>Cotap is mobile messaging for business. I built the Cotap iOS app from the ground up. After that, I built the Android app too.</p>

          <p>From there I became director of the Android team, and was later promoted to Product Manager.</p>

          <p>I independently conceived, designed, and developed an iOS app for Pivotal Tracker, called TrackerBot. It quickly became the most popular app for Tracker, and was subsequently acquired by Pivotal Labs.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>LinkedIn Events</h3>

          <p>Together with a great product team, I launched LinkedIn Events. Since we were featured on the homepage, we had to scale from 0 to millions of users overnight.</p>
